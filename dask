To get pixel values for lat/long coordinates in a CSV file, you can use the following methods:

*Method 1: GDAL Python Bindings*

- Fast and efficient
- Supports various raster formats

```
import osgeo.gdal as gdal

Open the raster file
ds = gdal.Open('raster_file.tif')

Read the CSV file
with open('points.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    for line in csvfile:
        lat, lon = map(float, line.strip().split(','))
        
        # Convert lat/long to pixel coordinates
        x, y = ds.GetGeoTransform()(lon, lat)
        
        # Get the pixel value
        value = ds.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray(int(x), int(y), 1, 1)[0, 0]
        
        # Print or store the pixel value
        print(f"Lat: {lat}, Lon: {lon}, Value: {value}")
```

*Method 2: Rasterio*

- Faster than GDAL Python bindings
- More Pythonic API

```
import rasterio

Open the raster file
with rasterio.open('raster_file.tif') as src:
    # Read the CSV file
    with open('points.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
        for line in csvfile:
            lat, lon = map(float, line.strip().split(','))
            
            # Convert lat/long to pixel coordinates
            x, y = src.index(lon, lat)
            
            # Get the pixel value
            value = src.read(1)[y, x]
            
            # Print or store the pixel value
            print(f"Lat: {lat}, Lon: {lon}, Value: {value}")
```

*Method 3: Dask + Rasterio*

- Fast and scalable for large datasets
- Supports parallel processing

```
import dask
import rasterio

Open the raster file
with rasterio.open('raster_file.tif') as src:
    # Read the CSV file
    points = []
    with open('points.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
        for line in csvfile:
            lat, lon = map(float, line.strip().split(','))
            points.append((lat, lon))
    
    # Define a function to get the pixel value
    def get_pixel_value(point):
        lat, lon = point
        x, y = src.index(lon, lat)
        value = src.read(1)[y, x]
        return value
    
    # Apply the function to each point in parallel
    values = dask.compute(*[dask.delayed(get_pixel_value)(point) for point in points])
    
    # Print or store the pixel values
    for point, value in zip(points, values):
        print(f"Lat: {point[0]}, Lon: {point[1]}, Value: {value}")
```

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on performance, scalability, and ease of use.
