Here's an example code snippet that reads a CSV file delimited by `|`, creates a Pandas DataFrame, hits the URLs in the `URLs` column using the `requests` library, and saves the response in a new column:
```
import pandas as pd
import requests

Read the CSV file delimited by |
df = pd.read_csv('input.csv', delimiter='|')

Create a new column to store the response
df['Response'] = ''

Hit the URLs and save the response
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    url = row['URLs']
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        (link unavailable)[index, 'Response'] = response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        (link unavailable)[index, 'Response'] = str(e)

Write the updated DataFrame to a new CSV file
df.to_csv('output.csv', delimiter='|', index=False)
```
Here's how the code works:

1. We read the input CSV file delimited by `|` using `pd.read_csv`.
2. We create a new column `Response` to store the response from hitting the URLs.
3. We iterate through each row in the DataFrame using `df.iterrows`.
4. For each row, we extract the URL from the `URLs` column and hit it using `requests.get`.
5. We save the response text in the `Response` column.
6. If there's an error hitting the URL, we save the error message in the `Response` column.
7. Finally, we write the updated DataFrame to a new CSV file using `df.to_csv`.

Note that this code assumes that the `URLs` column contains valid URLs that can be hit using `requests.get`. Also, the response text is saved in the `Response` column, which may not be suitable for large responses. You may want to modify the code to handle these cases.
