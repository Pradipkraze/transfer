final 2The `chunked` method is not a valid method for the `DatasetReader` object in Rasterio.

Instead, you can use the `read` method with the `window` argument to read the raster data in chunks. Here's an example:
```
import pandas as pd
import rasterio

Read XY coordinates from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('points.csv', header=None, names=['x', 'y'])

Read GeoTIFF file
with rasterio.open('raster.tif') as src:
    # Get the block size
    block_size = src.block_windows

    # Create a window for each block
    windows = []
    for block in block_size:
        window = block
        windows.append(window)

    # Read the raster values for each window
    values = []
    for window in windows:
        data = src.read(1, window=window)
        for i in range(data.shape[0]):
            for j in range(data.shape[1]):
                value = data[i, j]
                x, y = src.xy(window.row_off + i, window.col_off + j)
                # Find the corresponding point in the DataFrame
                point = df[(df['x'] == x) & (df['y'] == y)]
                if not point.empty:
                    values.append(value)

    # Add the raster values to the DataFrame
    df['value'] = values

Save the results to a new CSV file
df.to_csv('results.csv', index=False)
```
This code reads the raster data in blocks using the `read` method with the `window` argument, and then finds the corresponding points in the DataFrame for each block. The raster values are then added to the DataFrame, and the results are saved to a new CSV file.
